- 👋 Hi, I’m Yash Arora
- 👀 I’m passionate about Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Natural Language Processing (NLP), with experience in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and a variety of machine learning algorithms.
- 🌱 I’m currently focused on enhancing vehicle detection using custom YOLO models with self-attention mechanisms and building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system integrated with Pinecone and Cohere.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cutting-edge ML projects
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/yash-arora-0407ar/
- 😄 Pronouns: He
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love blending AI with real-world challenges—whether it’s improving vehicle detection or building smart Q&A systems with cutting-edge tech.
